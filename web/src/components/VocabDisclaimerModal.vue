      The vocabulary data on this page was pulled from my Kindle Paperwhite and then
      merged with some additional information from the
      <a href="https://dictionaryapi.com/products/json" target="_blank" ref="noopener">Webster Dictionary API</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Unfortunately, sometime in the Fall of 2020, the internal SQLite database
      on my Kindle got corrupted and stopped storing the words that I looked up
      while using it. This means that this dataset is an archive and not actively
      updated. Could I manually continue keeping track of this? Sure! But that sounds
      like a disruptive way to read and is not something I'm looking to incorporate
      into my reading habits at this time.

      May this be a lesson to also safely eject your USB devices after your finished
      using them. I have now learned the hard way. Don't be like me.
